            <p>
                Welcome to my page! I highly doubt it's what you were expecting, or maybe it was! *side-eye-side-eye* Don't take this seriously, or you might just go insaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaane! -_-
            </p>
            <p>
                I would be serious about this, but I'm too old, too tired, not paid anywhere near enough, and absolutely sober...

            <h2>About Moi!</h2>
            <p>
                I left school at the tender age of 13.75, only to rejoin after the summer holidays inevitably led to my downfall. Having failed in the conquest of "the rec", and being driven from the colloqially-named "****-stain drive", I sought my fortunes on the playground. Unfortunately, I was a dweeb... and slow... I will never outlive the trauma that is dead-arm drumming... may they never catch you, and if "it" may your feet be fleet!
            </p>
            <p>
                After the horror that was school, I went to college. It was ok. Got drunk on my 18th, and almost managed to flirt with my crush. (Somya, if you're reading this... you owe me a bottle of whisky.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I have arrived at university! York! Physics! My maiden! That's right, I'm not maidenless! Despair! I wish I could afford Elden Ring right now -_- So, yeah, uni... I passed. Got a First. Was easy. Didn't even try. Ignore the sleepless nights and cruddy dissertation. Regarding York: **** GEESE! iykyk </p>
            <p>
                Oh, then I tried and failed a PhD. It was OK... got a girlfriend finally... until she left... I'm not bitter, you're bitter!
            </p>
            <p>
                I wandered the Earth, glumly, for a little time; enough time to get some good gaming in! Oh, plus some work as a tutor, even stacked some shelves for a bit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Contrary to popular opinion, COVID was alright... what? too soon? Honestly, barely noticed it besides the mask steaming my glasses up every time I went to the shop... and as an essential worker I had the privilege of 3am 2 mile walks down ice covered roads to my job, for minimum pay... why do you keep calling me bitter?
